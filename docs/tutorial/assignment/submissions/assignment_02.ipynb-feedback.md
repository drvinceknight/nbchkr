You did not include a docstring. This is important to help document your code. 


It is done  using triple quotation marks. For example:

def get_remainder(m, n):
    """
    This function returns the remainder of m when dividing by n
    """
    ...
    
Using that it's possible to access the docstring, 
one way to do this is to type: `get_remainder?` 
(which only works in Jupyter) or help(get_remainder).

We can also comment code using `#` but this is completely 
ignored by Python so cannot be accessed in the same way.
